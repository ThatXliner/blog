As the first year of high school, I decided that I wanted to try to explore different ways to take note. Unlike middle school (where sometimes we were *forced* to take notes), I had a bit more freedom in how I wanted to listen to lectures in class.

## Some background before I continue

In the first semester of Biology Honors, we were forced to use this paper notebook. We had to write our deliverables and notes in this notebook.

## My experiences

### Handwritten, paper notebook

I already mentioned [how I structure my notes in a different blog post](http://localhost:4321/blog/posts/my-experience-with-the-kindle-scribe-part-1#deer-notes) and that I like to use color in my notes. Semantic coloring, if you will.

### Kindle Scribe

Again, I've talked about my experience regarding taking notes in the Kindle Scribe in [a different blog post before](./my-experience-with-the-kindle-scribe-part-2). Its lack of color was a huge turn-off when it comes to note-taking (for me personally).

### Obsidian

I love Obsidian. It's so powerful: its plugins, its ability to sync with my iPad and computer, its formatting capabilities, and of course, its cross-linking capabilities.

Sure, the Kindle Scribe and old-fashioned pen-and-paper has that physical handwriting element which is supposed to help with memory, but I've found that the benefits in Obsidian far outweighs this little fact, especially when I found an [awesome flashcards plugin](https://github.com/st3v3nmw/obsidian-spaced-repetition) for Obsidian. Obsidian has the advantage over the Kindle Scribe in that ~~its software is better and more customizable~~ it actually has color. Additionally, it still retains all of the advantages the Kindle Scribe has over paper, only at the cost of an inferior (or superior in a sense) display (a normal computer's OLED screen vs E-ink).

## What I learned

### Color is important

### Diagrams/graphics are great

### Accessibility is super important

## The future
