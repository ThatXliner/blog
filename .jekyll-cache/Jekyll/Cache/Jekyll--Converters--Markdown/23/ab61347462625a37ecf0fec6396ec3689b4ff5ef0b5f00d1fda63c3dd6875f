<p>Who’s fault was it then? Apple’s fault.</p>

<h3 id="background">Background</h3>

<p>Just yesterday, when I logged on to my computer, I tried to commit <a href="https://github.com/ThatXliner/poethepoet/commit/bc2985e8c1adfb5e90f09d65be03eebcdcf21f76">this commit</a> in my favorite editor (Atom, of course).</p>

<p>But this is when everything went wrong: the pop-up requesting my GPG key password appeared.</p>

<p>There’s nothing wrong with it except that it shouldn’t have popped up: I had the password saved to my <a href="https://support.apple.com/guide/keychain-access/what-is-keychain-access-kyca1083/mac">Keychain</a>. I never had to worry about the password for a <em>long</em> time.</p>

<p>In fact, so long that I <strong>forgot the password</strong>.</p>

<p>Being the smart guy I am, I have set different passwords for different accounts. So that way when one account is compromised, others won’t be.</p>

<p>What was my emergency plan? It was a simple, well-thought out, very comprehensive solution: <strong><em>panic</em></strong>.</p>

<p>And so I deleted my old key (since it was useless to me), deleted it from GitHub (later on, we’ll see how I regret this particular step), created a new key, and uploaded that to GitHub.</p>

<p>The first commit signed with my new key was <a href="https://github.com/ThatXliner/poethepoet/commit/bc2985e8c1adfb5e90f09d65be03eebcdcf21f76">the commit said before</a>.</p>

<p>Now, remember the step where I said I regretted it? The one where I deleted the old key from my GitHub account? Well, how come my old commits, say <a href="https://github.com/ThatXliner/slashtilities/commit/60c28ac4f981444722ce7140069fad37a7e846b5">this one</a> is still “verified”?</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/hey-its-still-verified.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>That’s because I <strong>recovered it</strong>.</p>

<h3 id="the-adventure">The adventure</h3>

<p>Did you know I have 2 computers? One of them was an old one and the other is my current one. What I did was simply this:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Go to my old computer</li>
  <li>Run <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">gpg --armor --export E3D27A8B9487AA0E</code> and copy the output (I could’ve done <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">gpg --armor --export E3D27A8B9487AA0E | pbcopy</code> but shush: this still works)</li>
  <li>Paste that into a new GPG key to GitHub. In other words, <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/managing-commit-signature-verification/adding-a-new-gpg-key-to-your-github-account">tell GitHub about it</a></li>
</ol>

<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>

<p>In the future, I will need to remember my passwords better. At least I have an action plan now, better than “panic”.</p>
