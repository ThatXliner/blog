I"–<p>Because itâ€™s great.
<!--END EXCERPT--></p>

<p>No seriously: Iâ€™ve seen <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_Lesser_General_Public_License">LGPL</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIT_License">MIT</a> (and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BSD_licenses">BSD</a>), <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affero_General_Public_License">AGPL</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_License">Apache</a> (which are pretty great, not gonna lie), but <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_General_Public_License">GPL</a> seems like the way to go!</p>

<h3 id="why-licenses-skip-this-if-you-know-what-licenses-are">Why licenses (skip this if you know what licenses are)</h3>

<p>Being a developer, proprietary or not, you need to tell the user (or client) how they can use the software. Some (bad) people would want to leak your secret code.
Others may want to steal credit from your <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_source">open source</a> (read: <em>free</em>) code. A software license is a file that inform the client what permissions they have over your software.</p>

<p>Basically, itâ€™s a buncha text saying what you can do with this <em>epic code</em>.</p>

<h3 id="tldr">TL;DR</h3>

<p>Hereâ€™s a rundown on the licenses:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>MIT (or BSD)-like licenses are just saying â€œDo anything you want with the software and/or code. Just donâ€™t get me in legal trouble.â€</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Apache License says â€œDo what you want, just donâ€™t get me in legal trouble. Also, you canâ€™t patent this baby.â€</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>GNU GPL (or just GPL): â€œYo, you proprietary companies want to use this boy? Come and get it â€˜cause youâ€™re gonna have to <strong><em>risk open source-ing your propritary code</em></strong> (and some other conditions). But, Iâ€™ve must give everyone the rights to view (the source code), modify, and distributeâ€¦ sigh: thatâ€™s a lot of permissions and.â€</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>GNU LGPL (or just LGPL): â€œIâ€™m just GNU GPL like but yâ€™all proprietary people can use this code. Yes, youâ€™re protected by my permissionsâ€ (useful for small libraries)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>GNU AGPL (or just AGPL): â€œIâ€™m also like GNU GPL but all modified copies must release the source code.â€ Useful for servers: it <strong>prevents people from milking your code <em>over a network.</em></strong> So they canâ€™t exactly milk your HTML or JavaScriptâ€¦ HAHA PROPRIETARY COMPANIES!!! ğŸ˜</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="my-choice">My choice</h3>

<p>Now youâ€™ve seen the options, hereâ€™s my choice (drumroll please)â€¦.</p>

<p><strong>GNU GPL v3+</strong> ğŸ˜±</p>

<h3 id="why">Why</h3>

<p>When I write code (usually open source and hosted with â¤ï¸  by <a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a>), I donâ€™t want proprietary companies benefiting (and profiting) from my code when I donâ€™t.</p>

<p>When you license code as GNU GPL, youâ€™re basically saying</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Haha! Get rekt, proprietary hoggers! You canâ€™t use my code while other people can!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I believe that software should be freeâ€¦. <strong>as in freedom</strong>. You are free to distibute, use, and modify. Although if you want to fork any project licensed with the GPL (and make the forked code public), it must be <del>open source</del> GNU GPL (v3) (because you also have to make sure the client can see the source code). Thatâ€™s one of the permissions I must give you.</p>

<p>In other words, I do not want proprietary companies having an advantage. They canâ€™t use my library without making their app GNU GPL. ğŸ˜</p>

<p>Even if these licenses seem like there will be no cost, you technically <em>can</em> use it for commercial purposes. Itâ€™s just that itâ€™s quite useless to do that: you have to make the code freely distributed where then some guy or girl <em>could</em> (and itâ€™s totally allowed under GNU GPL) distibute a free copy with <strong>zero changes</strong>. Or as much changes as they like.</p>

<p>Like I said, the distributed fork or copy <em>has</em> to be GNU GPL (v3 or the same version of GNU GPL). Iâ€™m also pretty sure theyâ€™re not allowed to steal credit.</p>

<p>GNU GPL is to code as America is to guns: free as in freedom.</p>

<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>

<p>Currently, I have spent $0 dollars on the internet. I like that and want to keep it like that: we all benefit from free software. I want everyone to benefit from my code, but not in a way were I <del>wonâ€™t get credit</del> cheated on.</p>

<p>For a GNU (new) DAWN! For freedom!</p>
