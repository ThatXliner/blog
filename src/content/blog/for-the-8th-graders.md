**Please note that the content in this post is directed specifically to Valley Christian 8th graders going to Valley Christian High School**

When you're trying to choose what you want to do next year, like the classes and programs, there really just 3 things you should know before you make your decision. These are the things I wish people told me personally (this advice may not work for you at all).

## A bit about me

I'm an academic-focused programmer and musician (so my 2 categories are AMSE and Music) that goes to Valley Christian because it's a Christian school. I would recommend you read my [philosophy on high school](#my-personal-philosophy-for-high-school-in-general) at the end of this blog as it should really help with showing you my internal reasons for my decisions.

## What classes should I take?

In your freshman year, you have the time and you have the resources to be able to try everything, to try every potential aspiration that you would have. For example, if you have the slightest interest or curiosity in business (as I did) and don't know if you want to pursue it as a career, take Business Fundamentals. Business Fundamentals is a prerequisite to many other classes (such as Entrepreneurship Honors) or programs (like DECA), so taking it freshmen year can leave your options open in case you ever suddenly want to switch. In short, try to **keep your options open** (so you won't potentially regret it later on)

I did 8 classes in my freshman year. Do I regret it? Not really, although **I did envy** when other people were able to sleep in using their open period. They can just wake up at 8am and come to school at 9 o'clock, while I had to wake up at 6 o'clock every single day. But I would recommend you try taking 7 classes for all 4 years if you can, because of my [philosophy](#my-personal-philosophy-for-high-school-in-general)

Here are my ClassChoice advice:

- Try to double Chemistry and Biology as this:
    1. Keep your options open
    2. Help you meet prerequisites sooner for future programs such as COSMOS (see reason 1)
    3. Show colleges your interest in science
    4. Show colleges your willingness to "take a challenge"
    5. **May be the only time you are able to double science**. At this time of writing, my counselor told me that I was not going to be able to double physics due to the significant amount of people failing to do this double (i.e. doubling chemistry and physics but doing bad in physics, chem, or both).
- Do the honors versions of your classes. Not only will this boost your GPA (although honors classes don't matter as much), it helps filter out the "bad kids" so your school experience won't be analogous to trying to listen to someone whilst in the monkey exhibit of the San Diego zoo.
- I heard Biology Honors is easier than regular; I also heard English Honors is easier than regular. As far as I know, this is pretty much true, so yeah.
- For those in algebra 2 ready to take Pre-Calculus Honors, please try to transfer to Dr. Shim; he makes the tests and the standards and he's historically the better teacher. Additionally, everyone knows this so you'll likely have more friends you can ask about test, homework, etc.
- For those taking Algebra 2 next year, **please don't slack off in Algebra II**. It's an easy course if you pay attention; don't make it hard on yourself. Keep a positive attitude. I know you can do it!
- Don't take history unless you like history AND extra work or you are planning to take AP Human Geography (APHUG) as a freshman and no-life your GPA (boost your GPA as it's an AP course). Taking APHUG was not an option for me.
- Do band. I love band. (obviously this isn't a serious recommendation).
- **If you don't plan to do the AP version of the class** (e.g. AP Bio after you do Biology Honors) then **do try to apply for dual credit** IF AND ONLY IF you know for sure that you will do well in the class. You should note that I didn't dual credit Pre Calculus Honors because I was planning to take AP Calculus BC anyways.

Here's the thing about APs and Honors though: you **would rather take an easier course and get an A than take an AP and fail it**. This can show your  ability to know your limits to colleges. Please note that a lot colleges just take your unweighted GPA, so it's at a 4.0 scale (where AP and Honors don't change anything).

There's a saying that "freshmen grades don't matter that much" which I don't know if it's true or not, but I would stay cautious either way.

There's one class in particular that I want to talk about: AP Computer Science A. It's an extremely easy AP if you've done any sort of basic computer programming before. For me, it was essentially a free period that just so happened to boost my GPA (which, as established before, doesn't matter that much for freshmen). AP classes are better than the honors equivalent because they are widely acknowledged by colleges as "college-level courses" and can even get you college credit (I think...not too sure where I read that).

## What programs should I take?

There are many different programs in this school but in the end, there's only 4 categories:

- AMSE
- Business
- Art
- Sports

I would recommend you take (or at least apply to) as many after school programs as you have the time and interest. Notice how I didn't list energy as you really don't know your limits unless you test them, which freshman year is perfect for. In my opinion, the maximum amount of categories a sane person can do at a time is 2.

That's very limiting (I know), especially when you're part of a large-time-commitment program such as OAE (marching band) or FRC (FIRST Robotics Competition). I could not do both water polo and FRC without compromise. But DO STAY HEALTHY GUYS. Exercise at least every week and sleep at least 8 hours. Enjoy your optimal teenage body.

If I could go back in time and re-do 9th grade, the programs I would apply for (as they don't conflict) would be:

- FRC (but you could also apply to RoboQuest as it's like a watered-down FRC)
- ~~ISS baby program~~ (conflicts with FRC as it's every Monday)
- Debate
- Math team (because all my friends are there so if I don't, I'm lonely during Thursday lunches)

Funny enough, these are the programs I'm thinking of doing next year. I heard debate is a ton of work. My friend Amaar says that in order to stay sane, "do NOT do debate and FRC." I am totally disregarding his warning :D (let's see if I regret this).

### My program experiences

I **regret _only_ doing FRC**. I had gone all in because I was told it was selective. Funny story, since I was applying to the software division for FRC and got in, I had to get interviewed as the final step of the application. When I walked into the room, I already knew that I was going to get in: the 2 people who were interviewing me were the software leads who I knew before I applied to FRC. At that moment I knew _oh this is going to be easy_. Networking is powerful.

The ISS research lab in our school is really good, so if you didn't do the baby program in 8th grade (which is a hard prerequisite that you can't skip) I would recommend you do that right now in your freshman year.

I'm going to do the ISS baby program next year (and the research program junior year) because I didn't realize that the ISS program was actually that good. You actually can get a real paper published if you do well, and it's going to be impressive too. This is because it's actually something no one has done before even if all they do is take an existing research topic and slap the words "the effects of microgravity on" in front of the entire research topic.

## My personal philosophy for high school in general

TODO. Not really important and I wanted to get this blog post out ASAP so.

## Conclusion

But also you should remember: this is YOUR life. None of what I say is what you HAVE to do. Ultimately, your life should look completely different from mine (or else you won't stand out in college admissions) and always remember: college is not the goal. Good luck!
