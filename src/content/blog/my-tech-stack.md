When it comes to full-stack tech stacks, there are a lot of options, from LAMP (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP), MEAN (MongoDB, Express.js, AngularJS (or Angular), and Node.js), MERN (like MEAN but using ReactJS instead of Angular), [T3](https://create.t3.gg/), or [Fireship's FKit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFP7rUYtOOg) (Firebase + SvelteKit).

I like the idea of FKit, but since my Google account isn't good enough for Firebase, I propose an alternative: **SupaKit** (Supabase + SvelteKit).

## SupaKit

[Supabase](https://supabase.com/) will be used for the PostgreSQL backend and ORM.

[SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev/) is for the full stack routing framework and frontend.

Another thing about this stack is that I usually create it with [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) enabled with [pNPM](https://pnpm.io/).

So like the initial creation process would look like this:

![How I initialize a SvelteKit app](@assets/sveltekit-options.png)

TypeScript, [ESLint](https://eslint.org/), [Prettier](https://prettier.io/), [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/), [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/), everything.

I would also install [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) and [daisyUI](https://daisyui.com/).
