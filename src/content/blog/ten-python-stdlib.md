This is a _very short_ ~~blog post~~ list of 10 Python standard library modules (that I think) you **must know** (as of python3.9).

<!--END EXCERPT-->

In the next article, I will explain why I chose these 10.

NOTE: This doesn't mean you shouldn't learn the other modules. In fact, this list used to have **20** items.
I just tediously picked ten with a general audience in mind.

Anyways, here's the list:

- [Pathlib](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pathlib.html)
- [Re](https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html)
- [Subprocess](https://docs.python.org/3/library/subprocess.html)
- [Os](https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html)
- [Argparse](https://docs.python.org/3/library/argparse.html)
- [Math](https://docs.python.org/3/library/math.html)
- [Asyncio](https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio.html)
- [Random](https://docs.python.org/3/library/random.html)
- [Copy](https://docs.python.org/3/library/copy.html)
- [Sys](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sys.html)
