This is a *very short* ~~blog post~~ list of 20 Python standard library modules (that I think) you **must know**.

In the next article, I will explain why I chose these 10.

NOTE: This doesn't mean you shouldn't learn the other modules. In fact, this list used to have **20** items.
I just tediously pickede ten with a general audience in mind.

Anyways, here's the list:

 * [Pathlib](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pathlib.html)
 * [Re](https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html)
 * [Subprocess](https://docs.python.org/3/library/subprocess.html)
 * [Os](https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html)
 * [Argparse](https://docs.python.org/3/library/argparse.html)
 * [Math](https://docs.python.org/3/library/math.html)
 * [Asyncio](https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio.html)
 * [Random](https://docs.python.org/3/library/random.html)
 * [Copy](https://docs.python.org/3/library/copy.html)
 * [Sys](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sys.html)
