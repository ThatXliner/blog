Because it's great.

No seriously: I've seen [LGPL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_Lesser_General_Public_License), [MIT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIT_License) (and [BSD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BSD_licenses)), [AGPL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affero_General_Public_License), [Apache](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_License) (which are pretty great, not gonna lie), but [GPL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_General_Public_License) seems like the way to go!

### Why licenses (skip this if you know what licenses are)

Being a developer, proprietary or not, you need to tell the user (or client) how they can use the software. Some (bad) people would want to leak your secret code. 
Others may want to steal credit from your [open source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_source) (read: *free*) code. A software license is a file that inform the client what permissions they have over your software.

Basically, it's a buncha text saying what you can do with this *epic code*.

### TL;DR

Here's a rundown on the licenses:

 - MIT (or BSD)-like licenses are just saying "Do anything you want with the software and/or code. Just don't get me in legal trouble."

 - Apache License: "Do what you want, just don't get me in legal trouble. Also, you can't patent this baby."
 
 - GNU GPL (or just GPL): "Yo, you propritary companies want to use this boy? Come and get it 'cause you're gonna have to ***open source your propritary code***. But, I've must give everyone the rights to view (the source code), modify, and distribute... sigh: l"
 
 - GNU LGPL (or just LGPL): "Just GNU GPL but propritary people can use this code." (useful for small libraries)
 
 - GNU AGPL (or just AGPL): Like GNU GPL but all modified copies must release the source code. Useful for servers: it **prevents people from milking your code *over a network.***
 
### My choice
 
Now you've seen the options, here's my choice (drumroll please)....
 
**GNU GPL v3+** üò± 


### Why

When I write code (usually open source and hosted with ‚ù§Ô∏è  by [GitHub](https://github.com/)), I don't want proprietary companies benefiting (and profiting) from my code when I don't.

When you license code as GNU GPL, you're basically saying

> Haha! Get rekt, proprietary hoggers! You can't use my code while other people can!

I believe that software should be free.... **as in freedom**. You are free to distibute, use, and modify. If you want to fork this (and make the forked code public), it must be ~~open source~~ GNU GPL (v3).

In other words, I do not want proprietary companies having an advantage. They can't use my library without making it GNU GPL. üòù

Even if these licenses seem like there will be no cost, you technically *can* use it for commercial purposes.
It's just that it's quite useless to do that: you have to make the code freely distributed where then some guy or girl *could* (and it's totally allowed under GNU GPL) distibute a free copy with **zero changes**. Or as much changes as they like.

Like I said, the distributed fork or copy *has* to be GNU GPL (v3 or the same version of GNU GPL). I'm also pretty sure they're not allowed to steal credit.

GNU GPL is to code as America is to guns: free as in freedom.

### Conclusion

Currently, I have spent $0 dollars on the internet. I like that and want to keep it like that: we all benefit from free software. I want everyone to benefit from my code, but not in a way were I ~~won't get credit~~ cheated on.

For a GNU (new) DAWN! For freedom!
